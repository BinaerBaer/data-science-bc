# Functions

This is  a Codealong. So please, take your
time to implement all the code by yourself.
This will be helpful for you to better understand
the syntax of python code. The best way to get a better feeling
for Python is by playing with it.

At the end of each section there will be 
some questions to help further your 
understanding. Remember, 
in Python we can always manually test things 
by trying them out; however, 
you should try to think about the answers 
to these questions before you run some code. 
This way you can check and verify your 
understanding of the section's topic.
Please discuss further questions in your group of two.

## The way to success:

Please **work together as Pair Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

1. Functions_Exercise1
2. Functions_Exercise2
3. Functions_Exercise3 
4. Functions_Exercise4 (List-, Dict-Comprehention)
5. Functions_Challenge_Teamwork

**Part 5 (Teamwork-Challenge) will be conducted in
larger teams.**

In the additional overview, all labs of
this  repository (Functions) are again
discussed in detail.

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
