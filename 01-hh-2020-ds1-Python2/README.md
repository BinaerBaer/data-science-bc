# Data Structures in Python Part 2

Up till now you have learned about some very 
useful data structures in Python: 
numeric types, strings, and lists. 
However, the fun doesn't stop there! 
Now we are going to talk about some other 
data structures that will allow us to solve 
very different problems from those that we 
have been solving so far.

This is again a Codealong. So please, take your
time to implement all the code by yourself.
This will be helpful for you to better understand
the syntax of python code.

At the end of each section there will be 
some questions to help further your 
understanding. Remember, 
in Python we can always manually test things 
by trying them out; however, 
you should try to think about the answers 
to these questions before you run some code. 
This way you can check and verify your 
understanding of the section's topic.
Please discuss further questions in your group of two.

## The way to success:

Please work together as a team through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

1. Lists
2. Sets
3. Mutability (Tuples)
4. Dictionaries

In the additional overviews, the Data Structures of
this and the last repository (Python-Part_1, Python-Part_2) are again
discussed in detail.

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
