# OOP and Classes

In this repository you will learn the concept
of object oriented programming and when it might
be useful to work with classes and when not.

## The way to success:

Please **work together as Pair Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

1. Class 1
2. Class 2
3. Class 3
4. Additional_Overview_OOP_Classes
5. Classes_Assignments
6. Reverse_Polish_Calculator
7. Tic Tac Toe functions challenge

**Part 6 and 7 will be challenges that are conducted in teams.**

In the additional overview, all Classes labs are again
discussed in detail.

In the misc(ellaneous).zip folder you can read
about the differences and advantages of many
programming languages.

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
